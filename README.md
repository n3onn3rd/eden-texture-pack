## About

The Eden texture pack is a 32x32 resolution Resource Pack
for use on [play.mc-drugs.com](https://mc-drugs.com) on Minecraft Java 1.16.
It is inspired by, and works heavily of off [Faithful MC](https://faithful.team/). It is not a _complete_ texture pack, so you will want to have Faithful as well. It does, however, have a lot of custom models, textures, and many quality of life tweaks!
